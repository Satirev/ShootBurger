Server use 3 external libraries:
 - 1. websocket++ (header only library) + boost.asio
 - 2. libboost_system.so
 - 3. libjsoncpp.so 

Server as well as websocket++ is strongly based on C++11, so entire project requires compiler (g++) in version 4.8.1 or higher.

BUILD:

In order to compile Server, first compile libjsconcpp library:
	
	scons platform=linux-gcc
 
After successfully build, copy libjson.so from jsoncpp-src-0.5.0/libs/ to directory CWD(current working directory)/libs

Next compile/download precompiled boost libraries.

Finally compile server:

	make -j(input number of threads)
